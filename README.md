Cars Dataset Prediction ML
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prepared data for modeling by cleaning and transforming it as needed.
Identified important questions and use cases for business to gain insights into data and extract meaningful information using visualization tools, such as plotting and graphing.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Developed and evaluated several supervised models, including regression and classification models, using advanced techniques such as random forest regressor and classifier, builidng fluency with scikit-learn Machine Learning in Python.
Utilized advanced models to generate prediction intervals or ranges, providing additional context and uncertainty estimates around the model's predictions.
